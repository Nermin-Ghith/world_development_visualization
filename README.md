## Dataset

We gathered the data set from worldbank.org. It includes several economic, health, natural resource, and social indicators in each country in the world beginning in 1960. Much of the data is missing for many indicators in many countries, and using all of the indicators would be cumbersome. We thus decided to use a subset of the variables with more complete data and relevance.
